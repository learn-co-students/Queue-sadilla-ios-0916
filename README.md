# Queue-sadilla

Quesadillas are delicious. They are the perfect marriage of tortillas and cheese, and can be beautifully adorned with salsas, sauces which are hot, and other accoutrements. 

What do quesadillas and queues have in common? They both start with 'que'. So let's make a que.

A queue is an ordered list that you can only at the end of (enqueue) and that you can only remove from the beginning of the list (dequeue). This means that a queue follows a FIFO, or First In First Out, policy. Just like when we wait on line for some Shake Shack, the first person in line is the first person served.

Wikipedia has a great article on queues as a computer science data structure:
[Queues on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type))

## Instructions

Make an FISQueue, make the tests pass! :)
